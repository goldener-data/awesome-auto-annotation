# awesome-auto-annotation

When training a new AI pipeline, the annotation process can be painful and quite costly. In most of the project, it is one of the main bottleneck in the release of impactful AI pipelines.
Then, leveraging existing AI pipelines to automatically generate new annotations is a way to acccelerate this process.

This repository is aiming to provide a curated list of existing solutions allowing to automatically generate annotations. The information is split by data type (image, text, video, sound, ...) and each of this section is giving:
* list of public repositories
* list of private tools
* list of scientific publications
