# Contributing to Awesome Auto Annotation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the awesome-auto-annotation
repository! This document provides guidelines on how to contribute to this
curated list of resources for automatic data labeling/annotation.

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of resources
demonstrating automatic data labeling/annotation across different data types.
By contributing, you help researchers and practitioners find valuable tools,
repositories, and scientific publications in this field.

## What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions that add:

- Public repositories implementing auto-annotation techniques
- Private/commercial tools offering auto-annotation capabilities
- Scientific publications discussing auto-annotation methods
- Updates or corrections to existing entries

## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Format

Each entry should follow the established format by data type:

#### For public repositories

```markdown
* [username/repository-name](link-to-repository): Brief description of what the
tool does and how it implements auto-annotation.
```

#### For private tools

```markdown
* [Tool Name](link-to-tool-homepage)
```

#### For scientific publications

```markdown
* Author Name(s). 
    [Publication Title](link-to-publication). 
    Journal/Conference Name and Details (year).
  ).
```

### Organization

Resources are organized by:

1. Data type (image, text, video, sound, etc.)
2. Within each data type:
   - Public repositories
   - Private tools
   - Scientific publications

For repositories, we further categorize them as "backend only" or "annotation
tools" based on whether they provide a user interface.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Create a Branch**: Make a branch for your contribution.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Add your entries following the format guidelines above.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes and open a pull request.

5. **Review Process**: The maintainers will review your PR and may suggest
changes before merging.

## Criteria for Inclusion

For a resource to be included in this list, it should:

- Be clearly related to automatic data labeling/annotation
- Provide value to the AI annotation community
- Include a clear description of how it implements or discusses auto-annotation

Note that inclusion in this list does not imply endorsement. As stated in the 
README:

> Warning, the intent here is to provide a list of sources claiming to
> use/implement auto labeling/annotation. Not all of these sources have been
> tested/verified and there is no guarantee that the expressed claims are valid.

## Maintenance

For repositories that become inactive (less than 1 year of activity), we may
move them to the "Deprecated repositories" section rather than removing them
completely.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about contributing, please open an issue in the
repository, and the maintainers will be happy to help.

Thank you for helping make this resource more valuable to the community!
